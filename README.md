<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

This messaging app began as my contribution towards a group work assignment at University, but has since undergone further development. The aim of the app is to allow users to instantly send and receive messages, in individual chats and group messages.

### How It Works
At its core, the app uses Socket.IO for real-time communication, ensuring that messages are transmitted instantly between users without the need for page refreshes. This real-time capability is essential for maintaining a continuous and engaging conversation flow. The backend is powered by Next.js, a versatile React framework that provides server-side rendering and static site generation.

For data management, the app uses Prisma ORM to interact with a SQLite database. Prisma provides a powerful and type-safe database toolkit, allowing for efficient querying and data manipulation. User authentication and authorization are managed by NextAuth.js, which supports various authentication methods and ensures secure handling of user credentials.

The frontend of the application is styled with Tailwind CSS, offering a responsive and modern user interface that adapts to different screen sizes and devices. The app has been developed to have a reactive and modern user interface across mobile and desktop.
